# Remember:

# Get text from a PDF in the following steps:
# Open the document: my_file_reader = open('my_file_path', 'my_mode')
# Open it with PyPDF2: my_pdf_reader = PyPDF2.PdfFileReader(my_file_reader)
# Select page: my_pdf_page = my_pdf_reader.getPage(my_page_number)
# Extract the text: my_pdf_page.extractText()
# Regular expressions are search patterns for texts
# Extract search patterns with re.findall(my_expression, my_str)
