What is lemmatization?
    It expresses the similarity between texts numerically.
--> It reduces words to their root form.
    It calculates the standard deviation of the frequency of words in different texts.
    It transposes words into their square form.


What is vectorization in NLP?
    Generating texts from vectors so that they can be read by humans.
--> Vectors are generated from texts so that they can be used by machine learning algorithms. The vectors are often based on the number of specific words in a text.
    Vectors are generated from texts so that they can be used by machine learning algorithms. This is usually done by assigning a number to each letter of the text.
    Generating texts from vectors so that they can be used by machine learning algorithms.


What are two typical vectorization methods?
    Standardization and bag of words
    term frequency–inverse document frequency and random forest
--> bag of words and *term frequency–inverse document frequency
    random forest and bag of words


What are stop words?
    Words that bring the model training to a standstill.
--> Words that occur very frequently in a lot of texts and don't carry much meaning, such as articles.
    Words that are misspelled and therefore cannot be used well.
    Words that occur very rarely in a lot of texts, such as foreign words.
