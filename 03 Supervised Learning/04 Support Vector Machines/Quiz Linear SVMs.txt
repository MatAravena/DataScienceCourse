Which statement about the decision plane is false?
    The decision plane determines which class a data point belongs to.
    The decision plane is determined by the distance to the support vectors.
--> The decision plane is always two-dimensional.
    The decision plane makes it possible to make predictions quickly.


You can think of the margin the width of the gap around the decision plane. What is the difference between a hard and a soft margin?
    A high value for C represents a soft margin. In contrast to a hard margin, this margin can contain data points.
    A low value for C represents a soft margin. In contrast to a hard margin, this margin cannot contain data points.
--> A low value for C represents a soft margin. In contrast to a hard margin, this margin can contain data points.
    A high value for C represents a soft margin. In contrast to a hard margin, this margin cannot contain data points.


What are the support vectors of a support vector machine with hard margin?
    These are the data points that have the greatest distance to the decision level.
    These are vectors that are perpendicular to the decision plane and point to the data points that have the smallest distance to the decision plane.
    These are vectors that are perpendicular to the decision plane and point to the data points that have the largest distance to the decision plane.
--> These are the data points that have the smallest distance to the decision level.


What is the correct code to initialize a support vector classifier with a Gaussian kernel and soft margin?
    model = SVC(kernel='gaussian', C=1000)
    model = SVC(kernel='rbf', C=1000)
    model = SVC(kernel='gaussian', C=0.0001)
--> model = SVC(kernel='rbf', C=0.0001)
