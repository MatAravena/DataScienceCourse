Which three types of layer do you find in most artificial neural networks?
    input layer, output layer and transfer layer
--> input layer, hidden layer and output layer
    output layer, hidden layer and activation layer
    input layer, hidden layer and transformation layer


Which activation function is well suited for the output neuron of a binary classification?
--> Sigmoid function
    ReLU function
    Cosinus funktion
    A fourth degree polynomial


You have instantiated an ANN with the code model_ann = Sequential(). How do you add a Dense layer with 50 units to the model, which processes the features as inputs?
    model_ann = Dense(units=50, activation='relu')
    model_ann.add_units(50)
--> model_ann.add(Dense(units=50, activation='relu', input_dim=input.shape[1]))
    tensorflow.keras.add_layer(Dense(units=50, activation='relu'))


How can you tell that an ANN was overfitted during training?
    The accuracy for the validation data is less than 5%.
    The difference between the loss calculated from the training data and from the validation data gets closer with additional training epochs.
    The accuracy for the training data is less than 5%
--> The difference calculated from the training data and from the validation data diverges with additional training epochs.
