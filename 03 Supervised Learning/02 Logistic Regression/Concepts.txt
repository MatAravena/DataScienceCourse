Logistic regression 
is a well-known algorithm for classification tasks. Although it's mentioned in the name, this algorithm can't be used for regression tasks.


The object  𝑒
is constant called Euler's number and its value is roughly 2.71


The Sigmoid function
 is that it only outputs continuous values between 0 and 1. 


Collinearity
In statistics, multicollinearity or collinearity is a situation where the predictors in a regression model are linearly dependent. 
Perfect multicollinearity refers to a situation where the predictive variables have an exact linear relationship. 


R²
The coefficient of determination 
measures how well a statistical model predicts an outcome. The outcome is represented by the model’s dependent variable.
The lowest possible value of R² is 0 and the highest possible value is 1. 
Put simply, the better a model is at making predictions, the closer its R² will be to 1.


One-hot encoding
is used to represent categorical features with new binary features that only contain `0` and `1`.


ROC curve
describes how the recall and false positive rate change with the threshold value.

ROC AUC
Receiver operator characteristic area under the curve
