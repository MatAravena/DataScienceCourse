What do decision trees use to classify data points?
    The distance to the data point's nearest neighbors.
    The slope and intercepts of a line or plane fitted to the data.
--> Branched decision rules similar to if-else queries.
    The distance between the projection of the data point and its neighbors in a space with fewer dimensions.


Which parameter of DecisionTreeClassifier specifies the number of decision rules?
--> max_depth
    random_state
    min_samples_leaf
    criterion


Which statement about a decision tree's hyperparameters is not true?
    Decision trees with a high max_depth tend to be overfitted.
--> Decision trees with a high max_depth tend to be underfitted.
    Decision trees with a high min_samples_leaf tend to be underfitted.
    Decision trees with a low min_samples_leaf tend to be overfitted.


How does numerical data have to be scaled so that a decision tree can it meaningfully?
    With StandardScaler.
    With MinMaxScaler.
--> The data does not have to be standardized.
    With OneHotEncoder.
