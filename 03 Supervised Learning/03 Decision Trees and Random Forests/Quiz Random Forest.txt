What can you determine with the n_estimators parameter in RandomForestClassifier?
--> The number of individual decision trees.
    The depth of the individual decision trees.
    The minimum size of the individual leaves of the decision trees.
    The random configuration of the decision trees

What is ensembling?

--> Combining several models to make one big model.
    Balancing out uneven target categories with undersampling.
    Increasing the amount of training data with bootstrapping.

How do the individual decision trees in a random forest differ from each other?
    They only work on different randomly selected features.
    They only work on different data points randomly selected by bootstrapping.
--> They work on different randomly selected features as well as on different data points randomly selected by bootstrapping.
    They aren't different.
