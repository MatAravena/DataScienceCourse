What kind of data should the target vector contain in a linear regression?
        un-ordered categorical data, such as nationality
        ordered categorical data, such as chart rankings
-->     continuous data, such as weight
        A linear regression is an unsupervised learning algorithm So it operates without a target vector.



Which code creates features as a DataFrame?
features = df.loc[:, ['feature_col']]




A simple linear regression model is fitted to the data. The regression line describes the model. Which statement is NOT true?
The regression line is defined by a slope and intercept.
All predicted points of the model lie on the regression line.
the regression line is calculated to be as close as possible to the data points of the training data set
--->The regression line always intersects the y axis at point [0; 0], i.e. at the x coordinate 0.



What code can you use to fit a linear regression model to data?
model.fit(features, target)



A simple linear regression model is used to calculate the taxi price (in EUR) using the distance driven (in km). The fitted model has the following parameters:
Axis intercept = 3
Slope = 1 What is the predicted price for a 5 km trip?
   
    1 EUR
    3 EUR
    5 EUR
--> 8 EUR
