Which of the following models can be described as a black box model?
    Decision tree
    Lineare regression
    Logistische regression
--> random forest


Which answer is not a model agnostic method for interpreting a model?
    Permutation feature importance
    Individual conditional expectation plots
    Partial dependency plots
--> Feature weights


Which statement applies to PDP and ICE plots?
--> A PDP is the average of all lines on the ICE plot.
    PDPs show a line for each data point indicating how the predictions change with the feature value.
    ICE plots show the average influence of a feature on the predictions.
    PDP and ICE plots can only be used with random forests


With permutation feature importance, the importance of a feature is described as a change in metric if the link between the feature and the prediction is lost. How is this implemented in the permutation feature importance?
    The feature is removed and the model is re-trained.
    The values of the feature are replaced by missing values and the model is re-evaluated.
--> The values of the feature are randomly mixed among the data points and the model is re-trained.
    The values of the feature are set to the same value for all data points and the model is re-evaluated.
