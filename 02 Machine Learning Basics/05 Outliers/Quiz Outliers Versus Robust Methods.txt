What is an outlier?
        A test data set with target values.
        A machine learning model that generally achieves a good level of model quality.
--->    An extremely unusual data point.
        A data set without target values.


Why are outliers problematic?
        They have an excessively small impact on the performance of machine learning models.
--->    They have an excessively large impact on the performance of machine learning models.
        They always represent incorrectly measured values.
        They are thus unimportant and unnecessarily increase the required storage space of the data.


When are key performance indicators and machine learning models described as "robust"?
        If the calculation uses few resources
        If their numerical values are only integers
--->    If they are hardly influenced by outliers
        If they do not contain any test errors


What is a robust alternative to the arithmetic mean?
        minimum
        maximum
        interquartile range
--->    median


What is a robust alternative to standard deviation?
        mean absolute deviation
--->    median absolute deviation
        mean squared error
        median
