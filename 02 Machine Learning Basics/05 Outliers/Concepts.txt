mean 
arithmetic mean --> sum(X) / Len(X)

median 
is the typical value of a distribution. It marks the middle value if you put the data in order from the smallest to the largest value.

median absolute deviation (MAD)
is a robust value for the data's dispersion. This describes the median of the distances from all data points to the median value of the data series. 

MSE
->The mean squared error expresses the mean squared distance between the prediction and measured value
The best is close to cero

Ordinary least squares -- ols
In short: the best hyperplane is determined by the mean of the sum of the squared errors, i.e. the MSE.
Depending on the values we choose for "Beta0" and "Vector de Beta" the MSE will change.

-- > In the case of two features, we can calculate their correlation coefficients. 
     If this is close to zero, you can assume that there is no correlation between the features. 
     If the value is 1 or -1, there is a perfect correlation and the assumption is clearly violated. 
     Generally speaking, you should be concerned if you have a value exceeding 0.9 or -0.9.

Hyperplane
is a generalization of a two-dimensional plane in three-dimensional space to mathematical spaces of arbitrary dimension

RANSAC
RANdom SAmple Consensus. 
As the name suggests, the point is that random samples only lead to similar model values if they don't contain outliers. 
RANSAC regression therefore assumes that the non-outliers, or inliers of the data set lead to the model learning approximately the same parameters, 
while the outliers produce all kinds of extreme deviations without consensus.
