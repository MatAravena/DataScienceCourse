What kind of machine learning model is PCA?
    It predicts continuous values, so it is a regression model.
    It predicts categories, referred to as classes, so it is a classification model.
    It arranges the data into groups, known as clusters. So it is a clustering model.
--> It extracts the most important dimensions in the data. So it is a dimensionality reduction model.

What does the hyperparameter n_components of PCA stand for?
--> The number of principal components on which the data are projected.
    The number of features you want to get rid of.
    The number of data points which are transformed.
    The number of data points you want to remove.

Imagine you instantiated PCA and named the new variable model. You then fitted model to the data. How can you check the quality of the projection?
    model.best_score_
    model.n_components_
--> model.explained_variance_ratio_
    model.labels_

What is feature engineering?
--> Changing existing column values and creating new columns
    Cleaning up existing columns
    Cleaning up existing rows
    Changing existing row values and creating new rows

What exactly does principal component analysis (PCA) do?
    It transforms the feature matrix to the target vector.
--> It looks for the direction of the greatest variance and projects the data points onto it.
    It assigns the data points to the nearest cluster.
    It divides the data set into a training data set and a test data set
