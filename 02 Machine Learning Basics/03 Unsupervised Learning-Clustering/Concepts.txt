K-Means 



DBSCAN stands for Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise
DBSCAN works as follows:

A maximum distance eps is defined.
All points that have at least min_samples of neighbors within this radius, are what are known as core points of a cluster
Data points that are close enough to core points but don't have enough neighbors themselves are called border points
Neighboring core and directly reachable points are assigned to the same cluster
Data points that lie outside a cluster's neighborhood that don't have enough neighbors themselves to form their own cluster, are known as outliers or noise points
