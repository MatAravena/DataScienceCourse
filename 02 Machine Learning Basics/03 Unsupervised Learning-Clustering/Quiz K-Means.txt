What kind of machine learning model is k-means?
    It predicts continuous values, so it is a regression model.
    It predicts categories, referred to as classes, so it is a classification model.
--> It arranges the data into groups, known as clusters. So it is a clustering model.
    It extracts the most important dimensions in the data. So it is a dimensionality reduction model.

What does the k of k-means stand for?
    The number of features the model uses for the cluster analysis.
--> The number of clusters you want it to form.
    The number of nearest data points that are required for at least one cluster.
    The minimum distance that a cluster center must maintain to another cluster center.        

Imagine you instantiated KMeans and named the new variable model. Which method ensures that the cluster centers are fitted to the data in the variable data.
    model.predict(data) 
    model.transform(data)
--> model.fit(data)
    model.labels_        

What distance measure does KMeans use to calculate the distance between cluster centers and data points?
--> The Euclidean distance
    the Cosine similarity
    The Manhattan Distance
    None, the distance is not relevant for the algorithm
