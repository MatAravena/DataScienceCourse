MSE
->The mean squared error expresses the mean squared distance between the prediction and measured value
The best is close to cero

R²
The coefficient of determination indicates how much dispersion in the data can be explained by the linear regression model.
The coefficient of determination (R²) is a number between 0 and 1 that measures how well a statistical model predicts an outcome.
The worst (R²) value a standardlinear regression can create is zero

Overfitting
-> describes the state of a machine learning model, which predicts training data much better than test data.
You only start to see a discrepancy between training data and test data when you start using a lot of features.
A model with many features can only predict the training data it trained with well. If you give it independent new test data, it is totally overwhelmed

bias
describes the average prediction error across different training datasets. A model with a very high bias hardly changes when the training data changes

Variance
describes how sensitively the model reacts to changes in the training data set. A model with a very high variance changes a lot when the training data changes

bias and variance
you need models that are neither simple (simple models have high bias) nor complex (complex models have high variance).
So somewhere in the middle there is a model that is "medium complex"

Ridge regression,
also known as Tikhonov regularization uses regularization to avoid overfitting. When the model is fitted to the data, there are two objectives that should be pursued:
Keep the difference between predicted and actual target values as small as possible.
Keep the sum of the squared slopes (e.g.  (𝑠𝑙𝑜𝑝𝑒1)2+(𝑠𝑙𝑜𝑝𝑒2)2 ) as small as possible.

Correlation
If this is close to zero, you can assume that there is no correlation between the features.
If the value is 1 or -1, there is a perfect correlation and the assumption is clearly violated.
