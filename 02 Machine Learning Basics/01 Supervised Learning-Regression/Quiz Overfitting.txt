Which trained regression model is most likely to suffer from overfitting?
        a simple linear regression model with one feature
        a multiple linear regression model with two features
        a multiple linear regression model with five features
-->     a multiple linear regression model with 100 features


If a machine learning model predicts training data much better than test data, this is called overfitting. Which measures are suitable for evaluating the quality of the predictions?
        the standard deviation and mean of the predicted values
        the difference between feature and target values
-->     the mean squared error and the coefficient of determination
        the difference between the number of predicted values and the number of cases in the training data


A model with a high bias barely changes with the data, while a model with a high variance changes too much with the data and is can't be generalized. Which statement is true for a model that suffers from overfitting?
        the model bias is too strong.
-->     the model variance is too strong.
        both bias and variance are too strong.
        neither bias nor variance are strong enough.


What can be done to avoid overfitting?
        add lots of additional features
        reduce the size of the training data set
-->     simplify the model, for example by reducing the number of features
        draw a scatter plot


A measure of model complexity is the number of features used. Which regression model probably provides the best predictions for unknown data?
-->     The model that best predicts test data according to mean squared error.
        The model that best predicts training data according to mean squared error.
        The model that uses the fewest features
        The model that uses the most features
