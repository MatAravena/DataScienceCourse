What kind of machine learning model is k-nearest neighbors?
        It predicts continuous values, so it is a regression model.
--->    It predicts categories, referred to as classes. So it is a classification model.
        It arranges the data into groups, known as clusters. So it is a clustering model.
        It extracts the most important dimensions in the data. So it is a dimensionality reduction model.


What does the k of k-nearest neighbors stand for?
        The number of features the model uses for classification.
        The number of categories (classes) in the target vector.
--->    The number of nearest data points that determine the classification of an unknown data point.
        Konrad, the first name of the statistician who developed k-nearest neighbors.


Imagine a pregnancy test reveals a total of two pregnancies in a total sample of 10 women. For two out of six pregnant women in this group, the test is correct and indicates pregnancy. 
What does that mean for the quality of the test?
--->    The recall is only 33%.
        The accuracy is 33%.
        The precision is 33%.
        The coefficient of determination is 33%.


Which model quality metric should a spam filter for a classification meet as a priority?
        The recall
--->    The precision
        The coefficient of determination (RÂ²)
        The harmonic mean between precision and recall (F1 score)


Imagine that a pregnancy test indicates a pregnancy for two people that are in fact pregnant and four people who are not pregnant. What does that mean for the quality of the test?
        The recall is only 67%.
        The accuracy is 50%.
--->    The precision is 33%.
        The coefficient of determination is 100%.
